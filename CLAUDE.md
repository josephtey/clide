# Clide - Claude Instructions

This file contains behavioral instructions for Claude when operating the Clide task orchestration system.

## System Overview

You are operating a centralized task management system that orchestrates Claude sub-agents across multiple project repositories. Your role is to:
1. Parse user commands and execute the appropriate workflows
2. Manage task state in `data/tasks.json`
3. Generate task specifications in `tasks/{id}/spec.md`
4. Spawn and monitor sub-agents for task execution in background
5. Stream and log agent output to `tasks/{id}/agent.log`

## Command Patterns

### 1. Create Task

**User input patterns:**
- "Create task for `<repo-name>`: `<title>`. `<description>`"
- "Add task for `<repo-name>`: `<title>`. `<description>`"
- "New task for `<repo-name>`: `<title>`. `<description>`"

**Workflow:**

1. **Enter Plan Mode:**
   - Use the `EnterPlanMode` tool to start a planning session
   - This allows you to have a conversation with the user to clarify requirements

2. **Planning Phase (in plan mode):**
   - Explore the target repository to understand existing patterns
   - Ask clarifying questions about:
     - Exact requirements and edge cases
     - UI/UX preferences
     - Technology choices (if applicable)
     - Integration points with existing code
     - Testing expectations
   - Use `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep` tools to understand the codebase
   - Draft the implementation plan collaboratively with user

3. **Create Spec File:**
   - The plan mode document becomes the spec file
   - Create directory `tasks/{id}/` (get next_id from data/tasks.json first)
   - Write the plan to `tasks/{id}/spec.md`
   - Include:
     - Task title and ID
     - Repository information
     - Detailed requirements from planning conversation
     - Implementation approach agreed upon with user
     - Files to modify/create
     - Success criteria
   - Use `ExitPlanMode` when the spec is complete

4. **Register Task:**
   - Read `data/tasks.json` to get the next task ID
   - Resolve repository path from `data/repos.json` (ask user if unknown)
   - Update `data/tasks.json`:
     - Add new task object with status "todo"
     - Increment `next_id`
     - Set `created_at` timestamp
     - Reference the spec file created in plan mode
   - Confirm task creation with ID and spec file path

**Validation:**
- Repository name must be provided
- Title must be non-empty
- Spec file must be created through plan mode first
- Repository path must exist (or be confirmed by user)

**Example spec format (created during plan mode):**
```markdown
# Task #{id}: {title}

**Repository:** {repo}
**Status:** TODO
**Created:** {timestamp}

## Requirements

{detailed requirements from planning conversation}

## Implementation Approach

{approach agreed upon with user, including:}
- Files to modify: path/to/file1.ts, path/to/file2.tsx
- New files to create: path/to/newfile.ts
- Key implementation steps
- Technology/library choices

## Implementation Details

{specific details discovered during codebase exploration:}
- Existing patterns to follow
- Components/functions to integrate with
- Styling approach (CSS modules, Tailwind, etc.)
- State management approach

## Success Criteria

- Feature works as described
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Code follows repository conventions
- All tests pass (if applicable)
- {any additional criteria from planning}
```

**Important:**
- ALWAYS use plan mode for task creation - never generate specs without user input
- The planning conversation ensures specs are clear and actionable
- User approves the plan before the task is registered

### 2. List Tasks

**User input patterns:**
- "List tasks"
- "Show all tasks"
- "Show tasks"
- "What tasks do we have?"

**Workflow:**
1. Read `data/tasks.json`
2. Display all tasks in format:
   ```
   Tasks:
   #{id} [{STATUS}] {repo} - {title}
   #{id} [{STATUS}] {repo} - {title} (branch: {branch})
   ```
3. Include branch name for IN_PROGRESS and COMPLETED tasks
4. Show tasks in ascending ID order

**Status display:**
- `TODO` - Ready to be assigned
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Agent currently working
- `COMPLETED` - Implementation finished
- `FAILED` - Encountered errors

### 3. Show Task Details

**User input patterns:**
- "Show task `<id>`"
- "View task `<id>`"
- "Task `<id>` details"

**Workflow:**
1. Read `data/tasks.json` and find task by ID
2. Read the task's spec file
3. Display:
   - Task metadata (ID, repo, status, timestamps, branch)
   - Full specification content

**Validation:**
- Task ID must exist
- Error if task not found

### 4. Assign Task

**User input patterns:**
- "Assign task `<id>`"
- "Start task `<id>`"
- "Execute task `<id>`"

**Workflow:**
1. **Validate:**
   - Task exists
   - Task status is "todo"
   - Current in_progress tasks < max_parallel_tasks (from data/tasks.json config, default: 3)

2. **Create git worktree:**
   - Run `scripts/init-worktree.sh` with repo_path, task_id, and branch name
   - Capture worktree_path from script output
   - Add entry to `data/worktrees.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "task_id": {id},
       "repo": "{repo}",
       "repo_path": "{repo_path}",
       "worktree_path": "{captured_path}",
       "branch": "feature/task-{id}",
       "created_at": "{timestamp}",
       "status": "active"
     }
     ```

3. **Update task state:**
   - Set status to "in_progress"
   - Set `assigned_at` timestamp
   - Set `branch` to `feature/task-{id}`
   - Set `worktree_path` to the captured path from script
   - Save `data/tasks.json`

4. **Spawn sub-agent:**
   - Use the Task tool with `subagent_type="general-purpose"`
   - **Run in FOREGROUND** (do NOT use `run_in_background=true`)
   - Provide comprehensive prompt including:
     - Task specification (read from spec file)
     - Repository path
     - Branch name to create
     - Git workflow instructions
     - Implementation expectations
     - `dangerouslyDisableSandbox=true` for all Bash commands to bypass permission prompts

5. **Sub-agent prompt structure:**
   ```
   You are implementing a feature for the {repo} repository.

   REPOSITORY: {worktree_path}
   BRANCH: feature/task-{id}

   TASK SPECIFICATION:
   {contents of spec file}

   INSTRUCTIONS:
   1. You are already in a git worktree at {worktree_path}
   2. The branch feature/task-{id} is already created and checked out
   3. Navigate to the worktree directory
   4. Implement the feature according to the specification
   5. Test your implementation
   6. Commit your changes with a descriptive message
   7. Push the branch to the remote repository

   REQUIREMENTS:
   - Follow existing code patterns in the repository
   - Ensure all changes are functional and tested
   - Do not modify unrelated code
   - Write clean, maintainable code
   - Include appropriate error handling
   - Use dangerouslyDisableSandbox=true for ALL Bash commands to bypass permission prompts

   When complete, the branch should be ready for review and merging.
   ```

6. **Save agent output to log:**
   - After the agent completes (foreground execution), the conversation transcript is available
   - Write the agent's work summary to `tasks/{id}/agent.log`
   - Include key actions taken, files modified, and final status

7. **Monitor completion:**
   - Since agent runs in foreground, it blocks until complete
   - When complete:
     - If successful:
       - Update task status to "completed", set `completed_at`
       - Add task to merge queue (data/merge-queue.json) with status "waiting"
       - Set task `merge_status` to "waiting"
       - Run `scripts/cleanup-worktree.sh` to remove worktree
       - Update data/worktrees.json entry status to "removed"
       - Notify user: "Task {id} completed. Branch feature/task-{id} ready for review. Use 'Process merge queue' when ready to merge."
     - If failed:
       - Update task status to "failed", capture error message
       - Run `scripts/cleanup-worktree.sh` to remove worktree
       - Update data/worktrees.json entry status to "removed"
     - Save `data/tasks.json`
     - Kill the tail background process

**Error handling:**
- If max parallel tasks reached, error with: "Already running {count} tasks (max: {max_parallel_tasks}). Wait for a task to complete or increase max_parallel_tasks in data/tasks.json config."
- If task doesn't exist: "Task {id} not found."
- If task isn't in todo status: "Task {id} is {current_status}. Can only assign tasks with 'todo' status."
- If worktree creation fails: "Failed to create worktree for task {id}. Check that branch doesn't already exist."

### 5. Assign Multiple Tasks

**User input patterns:**
- "Assign tasks `<id1>`, `<id2>`, `<id3>`"
- "Start tasks `<id1>` and `<id2>`"
- "Execute tasks `<id1>` `<id2>` `<id3>`"

**Workflow:**
1. **Validate all tasks:**
   - All task IDs exist
   - All tasks have status "todo"
   - Current in_progress count + new tasks <= max_parallel_tasks

2. **For each task, execute the standard assignment workflow:**
   - Create git worktree
   - Update task state
   - Spawn sub-agent in foreground (sequential execution)
   - Add to data/worktrees.json

3. **Notify user:**
   - List all assigned tasks with their IDs and worktree paths
   - Provide log viewing commands for each task
   - Note how many task slots are now occupied

**Error handling:**
- If any task doesn't exist or isn't "todo", reject entire batch
- If batch would exceed max_parallel_tasks, error with current count and limit
- If any worktree creation fails, clean up already-created worktrees and error

### 6. Process Merge Queue

**User input patterns:**
- "Process merge queue"
- "Merge next task"
- "Merge completed tasks"

**Workflow:**
1. **Read merge queue:**
   - Read `data/merge-queue.json`
   - Find first task with status "waiting"
   - If queue is empty or no waiting tasks, notify user

2. **Process merge:**
   - Get task details from data/tasks.json
   - Update queue entry status to "merging"
   - Run `scripts/process-merge-queue.sh` with repo_path and branch name
   - Capture output (SUCCESS or CONFLICT)

3. **Handle result:**
   - If SUCCESS:
     - Update queue entry status to "merged"
     - Update task `merge_status` to "merged"
     - Remove entry from queue
     - Notify user: "Task {id} merged successfully to main."
   - If CONFLICT:
     - Update queue entry status to "conflict"
     - Update task `merge_status` to "conflict"
     - Keep entry in queue for manual resolution
     - Notify user: "Task {id} has merge conflicts. Resolve conflicts manually in {repo_path}, then run 'Process merge queue' again."

4. **Continue if auto_merge enabled:**
   - If data/merge-queue.json config has `auto_merge: true`
   - Recursively process next task in queue
   - Stop on first conflict or when queue is empty

**Error handling:**
- If no tasks in queue: "Merge queue is empty. No tasks to merge."
- If merge script fails: "Merge failed for task {id}. Check {repo_path} for issues."

### 7. Retry Task

**User input patterns:**
- "Retry task `<id>`"
- "Restart task `<id>`"

**Workflow:**
1. **Validate:**
   - Task exists
   - Task status is "failed"
   - Current in_progress tasks < max_parallel_tasks

2. **Reset task state:**
   - Set status to "todo"
   - Clear `assigned_at`, `completed_at`, `error`, `worktree_path`, and `merge_status` fields
   - Clear existing `branch` name (will be recreated on assignment)
   - Save `data/tasks.json`

3. **Notify user:**
   - Confirm task has been reset to "todo" status
   - Suggest using "Assign task {id}" to retry

**Error handling:**
- If task doesn't exist: "Task {id} not found."
- If task isn't failed: "Task {id} is {current_status}. Can only retry tasks with 'failed' status."
- If at max parallel tasks: "Already running {count} tasks. Wait for one to complete before retrying."

### Repository Path Resolution

Repository configuration is stored in `data/repos.json`.

**When creating a task:**
1. Read `data/repos.json` to find the repository by name
2. If found, use the stored path and main_branch
3. If not found:
   - Check if `/Users/josephtey/Projects/{repo-name}` exists
   - If yes, add it to data/repos.json automatically
   - If no, ask user: "What is the full path to the {repo} repository?"
   - Store in data/repos.json for future use

**Adding a new repository:**
When user provides a path, add entry to data/repos.json:
```json
{
  "name": "repo-name",
  "path": "/full/path/to/repo",
  "description": "Optional description",
  "main_branch": "main"  // or "master", detect from git
}
```

## Student Context Management

Clide operates as a research lab with three student agents: Grace, Woody, and Rio. Each student accumulates context, learnings, and decision history as they work on tasks. This persistent memory allows students to build intuition and maintain continuity across projects.

### Student Profiles

Each student has a context file in `data/students/{name}.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "Grace",
  "role": "Product Builder",
  "focus": "Building a shared context layer for teams",
  "repo": null,
  "context": {
    "decisions": [],
    "learnings": [],
    "project_state": "Current project status",
    "last_updated": "timestamp"
  },
  "task_history": []
}
```

### Student-Task Assignment

**Mapping students to repositories:**
- **Grace**: No specific repo yet (working on context MCP product concept)
- **Woody**: `beyond-agents` repository
- **Rio**: `joetey.com` repository (floating, helps with various projects)

When assigning a task, determine which student should own it based on the repository.

### Context Accumulation Workflow

When a task is assigned and completed, update the student's context:

1. **During task execution:**
   - In the sub-agent prompt, include instructions to document:
     - Key architectural decisions made
     - Technical learnings and insights
     - Tradeoffs considered
     - Patterns discovered or established

2. **After task completion:**
   - Read the agent log from `tasks/{id}/agent.log`
   - Extract decisions, learnings, and insights
   - Update the appropriate student's context file in `data/students/{name}.json`:
     - Add to `decisions` array: `{task_id, decision, rationale, timestamp}`
     - Add to `learnings` array: `{task_id, learning, context, timestamp}`
     - Update `project_state` to reflect current understanding
     - Add task to `task_history`: `{task_id, title, completed_at, outcome}`
     - Set `last_updated` to current timestamp

3. **Context structure:**
   ```json
   {
     "decisions": [
       {
         "task_id": 1,
         "decision": "Chose Tailwind over styled-components for styling",
         "rationale": "Project already uses Tailwind extensively; consistency matters",
         "timestamp": "2026-02-01T10:30:00Z"
       }
     ],
     "learnings": [
       {
         "task_id": 1,
         "learning": "Server actions in Next.js 14 require 'use server' directive",
         "context": "Encountered bug when implementing form submission",
         "timestamp": "2026-02-01T10:45:00Z"
       }
     ],
     "project_state": "Built out initial dashboard UI. Next: implement real-time updates via SSE",
     "task_history": [
       {
         "task_id": 1,
         "title": "Add real-time task updates to dashboard",
         "completed_at": "2026-02-01T11:00:00Z",
         "outcome": "success"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Providing Context to Future Tasks

When assigning a new task to a student:
1. Read the student's context file from `data/students/{name}.json`
2. Include relevant context in the sub-agent prompt:
   ```
   STUDENT CONTEXT:
   You are {student_name}, a {role} working on {focus}.

   Your accumulated knowledge:
   - Previous decisions: {summary of relevant decisions}
   - Key learnings: {summary of relevant learnings}
   - Current project state: {project_state}

   Use this context to inform your approach. Build on what you've learned.
   ```

### Extracting Context from Agent Logs

After task completion, parse the agent log to extract:
- **Decisions**: Look for architectural choices, technology selections, design patterns
- **Learnings**: Technical discoveries, gotchas, best practices
- **Project state**: What was built, what's next

Use AI to analyze the log and extract structured context. Be thorough - this builds the student's long-term memory.

## Best Practices

1. **Always read before write**: Read `data/tasks.json` before modifying to ensure data consistency
2. **Atomic updates**: Update task state immediately before/after major operations
3. **Clear communication**: Confirm each operation with the user
4. **Error recovery**: Provide clear error messages and suggest fixes
5. **Parallel execution with isolation**: Allow up to max_parallel_tasks concurrent tasks using git worktrees for complete isolation
6. **Spec clarity**: Generate detailed, actionable specifications for sub-agents
7. **Manual merge review**: Never auto-merge; always require user to review and explicitly merge via "Process merge queue"

## State Transitions

```
TODO → IN_PROGRESS (via assign command)
IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED (via sub-agent success)
IN_PROGRESS → FAILED (via sub-agent error)
```

Invalid transitions should be rejected with clear error messages.

## Sub-Agent Monitoring

When a sub-agent is spawned:
1. Store the task ID from the Task tool
2. Monitor for completion using TaskOutput if needed
3. Update task status based on result
4. Notify user when task completes or fails

## Session Initialization

When the user first launches Claude Code in this directory, automatically:

1. Read `data/repos.json` to get available repositories
2. Read `data/tasks.json` to get current task state
3. **Display available commands and state:**
   ```
   Clide - Agent Orchestration CLI

   Available commands:
   • Create task for <repo>: <title>. <description> (enters plan mode)
   • List tasks
   • Show task <id>
   • Assign task <id>
   • Assign tasks <id1>, <id2>, <id3> (parallel execution)
   • Process merge queue
   • Retry task <id>

   Available repositories:
   - repo1
   - repo2

   Current status:
   - {X} total tasks
   - {Y} in progress
   - {Z} completed
   ```

4. If any task is "in_progress", alert user and show task details

This ensures users know what commands are available, which repos they can use, and the current system state.

## Important Notes

- Do NOT automatically merge branches - user reviews and merges manually via "Process merge queue"
- Do NOT modify the target repository directly - only via sub-agents in worktrees
- Allow up to max_parallel_tasks (default: 3) concurrent tasks using git worktrees for isolation
- Always preserve existing data/tasks.json, data/worktrees.json, and data/merge-queue.json data when updating
- Generate comprehensive specs - sub-agents need clear instructions
- Clean up worktrees after task completion (success or failure)
- Add completed tasks to merge queue for user review before merging
