# Task #13: Shorten Rosalind README

**Repository:** rosalind
**Status:** TODO
**Created:** 2026-02-14

## Objective

The current README is too long. Condense it to be much shorter while keeping the essential information.

## Requirements

- Shorten the README significantly
- Keep only the most important information:
  - What Rosalind is (brief, 1-2 sentences)
  - How to install/setup
  - Basic usage example
  - Link to docs if needed
- Remove verbose explanations
- Make it scannable and to-the-point
- Maintain the project's vision but express it concisely

## Success Criteria

- README is significantly shorter (aim for ~50% or less of current length)
- Still communicates the core value proposition
- Easy to scan and understand quickly
- Maintains professional quality
