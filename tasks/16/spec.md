## Description

Make two quick updates to "The Idea Factory" book on the bookshelf:
1. Change the year from 2025 to 2026 (move to currently reading)
2. Make the rainbow gradient more subtle (less saturated, softer colors)

## Implementation

- Locate "The Idea Factory" book in `src/components/BooksImReading.jsx`
- Change `year: 2025` to `year: 2026`
- Update the gradient to use more subtle, pastel-like colors
- Suggested subtle rainbow gradient:
  - Red: #E8B4B8 or #D4A5A5 (soft coral/pink)
  - Orange: #F5C99B or #E8B88F
  - Yellow: #F5E6A8 or #F0E4B4
  - Green: #B8D4B8 or #A8C9A8
  - Blue: #A8C9E8 or #B4CEE8
  - Purple: #C4B8D4 or #D4C4E8
- Ensure the stripes are still visible but more muted/vintage looking

## Success Criteria

- The Idea Factory appears in the 2026 section (not 2025)
- Rainbow gradient is more subtle and sophisticated
- Text remains readable on the new gradient
- Vintage Apple aesthetic is maintained but softer
